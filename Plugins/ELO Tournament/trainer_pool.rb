# ELO Tournament — trainer pool
#
# The real, full-roster trainer pool (as opposed to AIBenchmark's own
# buildTrainerPool, which is hardcoded to 6-mon level-70 squads for
# heuristic testing). Battle Tower trainers aren't excluded here by choice —
# they simply don't exist in GameData::Trainer at all; they're compiled into
# a separate Battle Frontier data structure (PBS/bttrainers.txt + a
# pokemon-index pool, no fixed roster), so GameData::Trainer.each never
# yields them in the first place.

    # Monument trainers (PBS/trainers_monument.txt) are real content but
    # intentionally out of scope (disjoint rematch/gauntlet roster, per
    # design). Everything else with a non-empty resolved party is included —
    # no further curation (legendary "trainer" wrappers, joke/dev battles,
    # etc. all stay in).
